Being passionate about IT and STEM in general for as long as I can remember, I
started my education at the [Katholieke Hogeschool
Leuven](https://www.ucll.be/nl), where I got a Bachelor of Applied Informatics
in 2013, with a specialisation in software development. Afterwards, I
immediately started my career at [Faros](https://faros.be/), developing in Java
and Spring as a back-end developer.

In early 2017, though, I decided to shift my focus to front-end development,
wanting to be "closer" to the end user and to pick up JavaScript, which was
rapidly upcoming in various frameworks. I joined
[Euricom](https://www.euri.com/) to participate in their boot camp, which
consisted of Angular and .NET Core. Although I never got to explore the latter
much, I've been going strong with Angular.

At the end of 2018, together with a friend and colleague, I started
[Appgrade](https://appgrade.be/). This new-found company of ours would attract
some employees over the years as well.

Apart from the professional side of things, I also like to hike to give my eyes
a rest from all the screens, travel and discover other cultures and food, or
play music. Truth to be told, it sometimes gets a bit overwhelming to combine
all these things ever since I became a father but I wouldn't have it any other
way.

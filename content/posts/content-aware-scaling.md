## Intro

Imagine you've got this landscape-oriented photo but you want it to be square.
In other words, you want to change its aspect ratio.

![The original image featuring a person on the left and a castle on the right](content-aware-scaling/castle.jpg 'The original image featuring a person on the left and a castle on the right')

In this situation, you've got a few options: you either crop the image and lose
maybe important or interesting parts of the image, or you accept the distortion
because everything will be squeezed together. But what if there's another
option? That option listens to the name of content-aware scaling.

![The squeezed version of the image, not losing any content](content-aware-scaling/castle-resized.jpg#small 'The squeezed version of the image, not losing any content')
![The cropped version of the image, not squeezed but losing content (darkened parts)](content-aware-scaling/castle-cropped.jpeg#small 'The cropped version of the image, not squeezed but losing content (darkened parts)')

## The idea

Content-aware scaling takes into account &ndash; who would've thought! &ndash;
the content when scaling an image. Instead of trying to cram _all_ pixels into
less (horizontal) space, why not omit the less interesting pixels in order to
perform the resizing?

## Finding the right energy

The key is to find these "less interesting" pixels. The less interesting parts
are definitely not the castle or the person standing on the left. If we take a
look at the clear blue sky on the right side and remove some columns of pixels
there, people would barely notice it.

The next question is, which columns exactly? And what other columns, apart from
those on the right side, can we remove before we start to remove important
parts? How do we calculate all of this?

### Greyscale

We start by turning the image into greyscale colours. In its most basic form,
this comes down to summing up all three colour channels (red, green and blue)
and dividing them by three to average them. More correct is to account for the
[relative luminance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_luminance). The
human eye is the most sensitive to green, then red and the least to blue. That
gives the following formula[^1]:

$$ Y = 0.2126 \* R + 0.7152 \* G + 0.0722 \* B $$

[^1]:
    This formula actually assumes the sRGB colour space is used and requires
    you to linearise the components. In my case, however, I don't need it to be
    _that_ accurate, though.

### Convolve using an edge-detection kernel

A kernel is a small matrix that is applied to every pixel (and its surrounding
pixels) of an image with the goal to, for example, blur, sharpen, or, as I used
it, highlight edges. The process of applying a kernel to every pixel of an image
is called convolution and goes as follows:

- you loop over every value in the kernel;
- you multiply that value with the matching (surrounding) pixel value (e.g. the
  top-left kernel value gets multiplied by the pixel value of the pixel to the
  left and above the origin pixel);
- you sum up the result of all these multiplications;
- the final result is the new origin pixel's value.

To give an additional example, the following kernel is like an [identity
matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_matrix) in the world of image
processing:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
   0 & 0 & 0\\\\
   0 & 1 & 0\\\\
   0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

An identity kernel is a "no-op" kernel: if you multiply all pixel values, the
zeros cancel out the surrounding pixel values while the one in the middle keeps
the origin pixel value, resulting in a net pixel value that is the same as
before applying the kernel.

#### Sobel operator

The Sobel operator is very useful for edge detection. It consists of two
kernels, one for the horizontal gradient and one for the vertical gradient,
indicating the change nearby pixels undergo. These kernels look like this (first
horizontal, next vertical):

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
   1 & 0 & -1\\\\
   2 & 0 & -2\\\\
   1 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
   1 & 2 & 1\\\\
   0 & 0 & 0\\\\
   -1 & -2 & -1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Combining both horizontal and vertical derivatives can be done by applying good
ol' Pythagoras' theorem and will finally yield the new pixel's value. If we
apply these Sobel kernels to our image from above, we get the following result.

![Edge detection applied to the original image from above](content-aware-scaling/castle-sobel.jpg 'Edge detection applied to the original image from above')

Notice how all edges are clearly visible &ndash; even the clouds! &ndash; and
comprise the "more busy" or important parts of the image. These edges should be
preserved and tried to not be selected first when choosing pixel columns (or
rows) to remove. Finally, note our intuition was correct. The space to the right
of the castle doesn't contain a lot of change so this makes it an ideal location
to remove some pixels from.

### Compute the energy

At this point, we've got a good view of the parts of the image that don't
contain a lot of visual changes. Next, we need to select a line or seam of
pixels that goes from the top to the bottom that is the least important or has
the least "energy". That is, if we sum up the pixel values of such seam, we want
this sum to be as low as possible, as darker areas are closer to zero (and
lighter areas closer to 255).

Let's say the 5 &times; 3 grid below represents our image and every cell is a
pixel value. Higher values are more bright and thus more important, and vice
versa. Maybe you'd think, let's start with the `4` in the first row as it's the
lowest number. Unfortunately, picking this number gets you stuck with higher
numbers on the second and third rows. If you had picked `8`, even though it's
not the lowest number to start from, you would've had access to lower numbers
from there on, resulting in a total lower sum. The correct path we have to
follow in this example is `8` &mdash; `1` &mdash; `4`, resulting in the smallest
possible amount of energy (or sum) of 13.

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
6 & 5 & 4 & 8 & 10\\\\
\hline
9 & 7 & 8 & 6 & 1\\\\
\hline
3 & 8 & 9 & 4 & 5\\\\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

An efficient way to calculate this seam is by using **dynamic programming**:
breaking down a big problem into several smaller sub-problems.

First, we need to calculate the energy of the cells of the last row. That
will tell us which seam has the lowest total energy. The energy of a
given cell is equal to its own value plus the smallest importance of the three
cells above it (i.e. just above, left and above, or right and above).

As the first row has no other rows above it, the energy of each cell of the
first row is simply the value of the cell itself:

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
6 & 5 & 4 & 8 & 10\\\\
\hline
& & & & \\\\
\hline
& & & & \\\\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

For the consecutive rows, we take a look at the row just above it. For the first
cell of the second row (having an energy of `9`), the calculation comes down
to:

$$
\min(9+6, 9+5)
$$

The second cell (energy of `7`) of that row is alike:

$$
\min(7+6, 7+5, 7+4)
$$

Continuing like this, we calculate the rest of the second row.

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
6 & 5 & 4 & 8 & 10\\\\
\hline
14 & 11 & 12 & 10 & 9\\\\
\hline
& & & & \\\\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

After the next (and final) iteration, we have calculated all energies. Again,
the values in the last row indicate the total energy it takes to reach this
cell, starting somewhere from the top.

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
6 & 5 & 4 & 8 & 10\\\\
\hline
14 & 11 & 12 & 10 & 9\\\\
\hline
14 & 19 & 19 & 13 & 14\\\\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

### Seams

In the end, we don't really care _what_ the energy is for a cell, we need to
know what exact _path_ was followed to reach this cell. And in particular, the
cell with the least energy. Luckily, this is an easy task. If we keep track
of the cell with the lowest energy in the row above &ndash; done at the same
time as when calculating the energy &ndash; we can backtrack our way to the
top. This can be done by keeping an additional `directions` array around
(storing top-left, top, or top-right) for each cell or storing the indices of
the ideal path. The latter is what I implemented.

Once you know which pixels to remove &ndash; again, in my case an array of
indices &ndash; you copy over the pixels of the coloured image _left_ of the
seam and you shift the pixels of the coloured image to the right of the seam one
place left. That way the pixels beneath the seam will get removed, creating a
new `(width - 1)` &times; `height` image.

![The red line shows the seam with the least energy and will get removed](content-aware-scaling/castle-seam.webp 'The red line shows the seam with the least energy and will get removed.')

In the image above, you can see the seam[^2] with the least energy that will get
removed.
[^2]: I made the seam a bit thicker to make it stand out more. Normally, a seam
is only 1 pixel wide, of course.

Finally, you can repeat all of these steps if you want to shrink an image more
than just one pixel. In the video below you can see all the seams that are
chosen to get the original image to half its width without distorting the image.

## Remarks

Of course, it's perfectly possible to resize an image in the height as well. The
same concept and techniques apply and both dimensions can be resized at the same
time too.

Performance-wise you can also make some optimisations. Think of splitting some
work to do in parallel (using the [Web Workers
API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API)) or not
doing some operations over and over again (e.g. turning the shrunk image
greyscale again).
